  # Amazon's Simple Storage Service
  #
  # http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/Welcome.html
  #
  # As S3 is much closer to a RESTful service than the other AWS APIs, all
  # calls through this API are done through these five handled HTTP METHODS:
  # GET, PUT, DELETE, POST and HEAD. When sending a request, follow exactly what
  # is described in the AWS API docs in the link above.
  #
  # So "GET Service" is
  #
  #     s3.get "/"
  #
  # When working with a specific bucket, pass in :bucket after the path:
  #
  #     s3.get "/", :bucket => "bucket_name"
  #
  #     s3.get "/?policy", :bucket => "bucket_name"
  #
  # For requests that need extra parameters, use the :params option:
  #
  #     s3.get "/object/name", :bucket => "bucket_name", :params => {
  #       "response-content-disposition" => "attachment"
  #     }
  #
  # Also use params in the cases that AWS asks for form fields, such as
  # "POST Object".
  #
  # A lot of S3 communication happens through request and response headers.
  # To specify a certian set of headers on the request, use :headers:
  #
  #     s3.get "/", :bucket => "bucket_name", :headers => {
  #       "x-amz-security-token" => "security string"
  #     }
  #
  # Many of the PUT requests require a body of some sort, sometimes XML,
  # sometimes JSON, and other times the raw file data. Use :body for this
  # information. :body is expected to be either a String containing the XML or
  # JSON information, or an object that otherwise response to #read for file
  # uploads. This API does not build XML or JSON for you right now.
  #
  #     s3.put "/object/name.txt", :bucket => "bucket_name", :body => File.open()
  #
  # This API does ensure that file data is uploaded as efficiently as possible,
  # streaming file data from disc to AWS without blowing up memory. If the
  # Content-Type header is not specified, it will be defaulted to application/octet-stream
  #
  # NOTE: Like the other parts of SimpleAWS, this API does NOT try to make the
  # AWS API better, but simply provides a cleaner, easy to use API for Ruby.
  # As such, this API does not offer streaming downloads of file data from S3.
  # That is up to you to implement at this time, by running a HEAD to get
  # Content-Length then repeated GETs using the "Range:bytes" header to specify
  # which parts to download next. You can see an example of this in samples/s3_batch_download.rb.
  #
  # Quality of Life note: if you forget the leading / (forward slash) in the path
  # of a resource when# working with a bucket, this library will catch the omission and
  # fix the path for you. Thus, the following is also a valid call:
  #
  #     s3.put "object/name.txt", :bucket => "bucket_name", :body => File.open()
  #
  # Raw file data in a response will be available in the #body method on the Response
  # returned by the method call.
